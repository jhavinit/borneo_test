API: Provide a RESTful API for search queries.
Web Interface:
Display search results with metadata and URLs.
Add sorting and filtering options.

Tech Stack:

Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI/Django Rest Framework)
Search Engine: Elasticsearch
File Parsing: Apache Tika, PyPDF2, python-docx
Frontend: React.js
Hosting: AWS, Heroku, or Docker Compose
